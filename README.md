# Running the app
at minimum all that is required to run the app is running it straight from the `index.html` file in the directory by double clicking on it.<br>
However if you want to run it on a live-server locally I have been using `atom` as my text editor and they have a package to install called<br>
`atom-live-server` all you need to do is open up `atom` and click on `File` then go to `settings` then `install packages` and search for `atom-live-server`<br>
after that is install you can open the project up in `atom` and click on `packages` go to `atom-live-server` and then click on `Start-Server`<br>
You will then have the project running on your local machine on port `3000` the browser will open on it's own no need to navigate there yourself unless<br>
it does not open.
